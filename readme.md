# CardGame
This assignment is a simple implementation of a card game using a deck of cards.

During this assignment I have experimented with GitHub Copilot and its strengths and weaknesses.
It has been used for research and documentation.
Copilot is an excellent tool for documenting, automating the tedious process of writing javadoc.
